//
// A PILE is a set of lines. Merging is a union over lines and nothing else.
//
// THREE AND ONLY THREE. A longer line would be a list of steps flattened into
// a tuple, and the flattening is not free — it puts a path's identity in the
// line's structure, and structure is not a string, so nothing can stand on it,
// name it, or join on it. A path worth recording is a VALUE, its own exact
// text, with facts about it written as more lines.

// --- a relation has a shape -------------------------------------------
//
// A VALUE IS ANY STRING. A RELATION IS UP TO FOUR FIELDS, comma separated:
//
//   "ip, resolves-to, has-address, host"
//
//   forwards   10.2.14.7       resolves-to host  backup-03.corp
//   backwards  backup-03.corp  has-address ip    10.2.14.7
//
// THE KINDS SIT AT THE ENDS AND THE VERBS SIT BETWEEN THEM. A relation always
// joins two kinds — the thing at the start is something, the thing at the end
// is something — and which one you land on is only a question of which way you
// walked. So kinds come as a PAIR or not at all. One kind would be a relation
// that knows what it points at and not what it points from, which is not a
// thing a relation can be.
//
// VERBS COME IN PAIRS TOO, so there are three field counts and nothing between:
//
//   ""                                    0  related, nobody has said how
//   "grows-on, grows"                     2  both verbs, kinds unsaid
//   "fruit, grows-on, grows, plant"       4  everything
//
// `""` is a producer certain two values belong together and unable to name how.
// It reads as `related` with `said` false, so it is never mistaken for a word a
// producer chose.
//
// WHAT YOU TYPE pairs a verb with what you land on — `grows-on plant` forwards,
// `grows fruit` backwards. Each is built from opposite ends of the relation,
// which is why `text` is assembled here rather than stored in the line.
