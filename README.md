Everyone's paperwork is a useless pile until somebody spends a week organizing
it. This skips that week: it cuts the pile apart and puts it back together so
the connections jump out at you the moment you look, with zero AI tricks.

```sh
./sw.ts                            # a shell over the pile
./sw.ts --taxonomy netops          # only a taxonomy's names
./read.ts 'host resolves-to/account/ticket'   # one reading, only the table
npm run gui                        # the page, at http://127.0.0.1:7474/
./scenarios.ts                     # replay saved readings as text
./cut.ts                           # cut and report, keep nothing (--debug writes pile/cut)
./sw.ts --introduce mine.pile      # one more pile, for this run only
./sw.ts --timing                   # where startup time goes, on stderr
./any2pile.ts < document.txt         # a raw document as a one-line pile
```

No build step for the tools: Node 24 runs the TypeScript as it is, so a local
import is spelled with its real `.ts` extension. The browser front end is the
one thing compiled — `npm install` once for TypeScript, then `npm run gui` builds
it and serves it at `http://127.0.0.1:7474/`. *One session, three clients* says
how the three fit together.

`pile/introduced/` holds eight files written by people and programs that never
coordinated: a DNS export, an auth log, a ticket export, two traceroutes, a
scraper that found pairs it could not name, a taxonomy of kinds, a nursery
receipt, and 930 lines of real data whose producer said as little as it is
possible to say.

## The line

```
[ value, relation, value ]
```

Exactly three strings. **A value is any string** — a document with newlines in
it, an address, a blob of whitespace. A line is one fact somebody wrote down:

```
["10.2.14.7", "ip, resolves-to, has-address, host", "backup-03.corp"]
["mike", "", "summer2006"]
```

Merging is `cat pile/introduced/*.pile | sort -u`.

## Three, and nothing longer

A line used to be allowed to run on — value, relation, value, relation, value —
so a traceroute could be written as one long line and a route would be a thing
you could read straight through.

That is a list of steps flattened into a tuple, and the flattening is not free.
It puts a route's identity in the **structure** of the line, and structure is
not a string, so nothing can stand on it, name it, or join on it. Everything
that followed came from that: you had to be *inside* a route to read it, which
meant a reader had to track a line and a position rather than a value, which
meant two kinds of move — one that stayed on the line and one that left it —
which meant a sigil, a mode on every step, a menu that offered every phrase
twice, and rows that were half quotation and half inference.

One removal took all of it out. A route worth recording is a **value**: its own
exact text, which you can stand on, name, and join on like any other string.
Facts about it are more lines.

```
["trace","trace, produced, produced-by, route","10.2.14.7,10.2.0.1,192.0.2.9"]
["10.2.14.7,10.2.0.1,192.0.2.9","route, hops, hop-of, ip","10.2.0.1"]
["10.2.14.7","ip, next, previous, ip","10.2.0.1"]
```

This is the pattern `rfg.pile` already used for all 930 of its lines: a whole
document sits in the pile as one value, and what was found inside it is written
as separate facts about it.

The admission that comes with it: a fact does not need a name, but **a path
does**. The old format was a way of avoiding that, and the price of avoiding it
was a second way of reading.

## Left and right are transcription. The middle is interpretation.

This is the most important sentence here.

A value arrives from the world. It can only be wrong by being copied wrong.
Nobody decided it, nobody is responsible for it, and no later knowledge makes
it a different string.

A relation is somebody making sense of what they saw. It can be wrong, and
over a long enough pile it will be. Two producers can read the same bytes and
write different relations, both in good faith.

So the two halves of a line are not the same kind of claim, and the format
should not pretend they are. Everything below follows from that.

## Introduced and cut

```
pile/introduced/   _auth.pile  _dns.pile  _garden.pile  …    kept
the cut            all of it, and what cutters made of it    in memory, never stored
```

One directory is kept, and the cut is not stored at all.

**Introducing** brings something into the pile: a raw document, whole, as a
value — or lines a person wrote by hand, because nothing can run a person
again. It is the one thing nothing can regenerate, so it is the one thing kept.
It is also the one step that is trivial to get right: it can only be wrong by
copying wrong.

`any2pile.ts` is the whole of it for a raw document — a file or stdin in, one
line out, the same line either way:

```
[<the whole document>, "document, is, is, document", <the whole document>]
```

No byte changed, no file name written down, and a document that is not valid
UTF-8 refused rather than copied wrong. Keep it with
`any2pile.ts doc.txt > pile/introduced/_doc.pile`, or read with it once with
`sw.ts --introduce <(any2pile.ts < doc.txt)`.

**Cutting** is everything else. A cut starts from every introduced pile and runs
every cutter in `cutters/` over what it holds until a round changes nothing. A
cutter is a function: `cutters/email.ts` exports one from every line of the cut
to its own lines, and what it returns becomes the pile `email.pile`. Nothing
registers it.

```
email       every email inside every value, split into user and domain
passwords   every PasswordRecord document, cut into records
```

A cutter is called in memory, not run through a pipe, and that is not a
detail. A document sits in every line about it — each record cut from it says
where it came from — and through a pipe each of those lines is the whole
document written out and read back in, every round, so the cost grew with the
square of the document. Handed to a function, those lines share one string.

Cutters are loaded by plain `node`, so a local import is spelled
`../stringwalk.ts`. Any other executable in `cutters/` — a script in another
language — is still a cutter, run as a process: every line on stdin as JSON, its
own lines on stdout. It pays for the pipe a function does not.

A cutter will be wrong sometimes, and that is why what it writes is never kept.
A bad cut is not a data problem; it is a bug you fix before the next cut. A cut
always starts from empty, because a cutter that reads what it wrote last time
can keep a line alive after the bug that wrote it is gone.

**The cut lives in memory.** `sw.ts` cuts every time it starts and reads what
came out, so what you read is what `pile/introduced` says now, and once you stop
nothing of it is left on disk. A stored cut would be a second copy of everything
introduced, in plain text, still there after you stopped reading — and it would
never have saved anything, because the reader recuts on every start anyway. A
pile is a named text, not a file: `_rfg.pile` and `email.pile` still say who
wrote what.

`--debug` writes the cut out, to `pile/cut` or to `--debug=<dir>`, for when you
want to look; a cut that fails under `--debug` writes what it had when it
failed. Every cut deletes `pile/cut` first, so a dump you forgot does not stay.
`./cut.ts` on its own runs the cut, says what came out pile by pile, and
keeps nothing.

**A pile can be introduced for one run** without being kept:
`sw.ts --introduce mine.pile`, as many times as you like, and `cut.ts` takes the
same flag. It goes through exactly what `pile/introduced` goes through —
`_mine.pile` in the cut, run past every cutter — and is gone with the process.
It is a path and not stdin, because stdin is where the shell's commands come
from; a producer still pipes in as `--introduce <(producer)`.

The underscore on an introduced pile is only there so it can never share a name
with a cutter's output. Inside the cut a pile is a pile.

## A relation has a shape

```
"ip, resolves-to, has-address, host"

forwards    10.2.14.7       resolves-to host   backup-03.corp
backwards   backup-03.corp  has-address ip     10.2.14.7
```

**The kinds sit at the ends and the verbs sit between them.** A relation always
joins two kinds — the thing at the start is something, the thing at the end is
something — and which one you land on is only a question of which way you
walked. So kinds come as a pair or not at all. One kind would be a relation
that knew what it points at and not what it points from, which is not a thing a
relation can be.

Verbs come in pairs, because every verb has a reverse phrasing — naming one and
not the other is not a state of knowledge, it is half a job. Kinds come in pairs
for the reason above. So three field counts, and nothing in between:

```
""                                 0   related, nobody has said how
"grows-on, grows"                  2   both verbs, kinds unsaid
"fruit, grows-on, grows, plant"    4   everything
```

There is no compatibility layer. An unnamed relation is a relation with the
optional fields left blank, and `rfg.pile`'s 930 lines walk without a special
case anywhere.

**The empty relation is the one that matters.** A parser that found `mike` next
to `summer2006` can be certain they belong together and have no idea what to
call it. Made to guess, it puts a lie in the pile. Made to drop the pair, it
throws away something it genuinely saw. `""` records exactly what it knew.

```
["mike","","summer2006"]
```

The reader calls it `related`, and marks it as the reader's word rather than a
producer's, so anybody — including the same parser later, knowing more — can
name it without that line changing.

## You type the kind. The verb is a qualifier.

What a reader is after is a thing — an ip, a ticket, an account. Which verb
reached it is a detail they may not need, so the kind leads and the verb
trails:

```
host                every way to a host from here
host resolves-to    only the one the dns export wrote
resolves-to host    the same, spelled the way a producer writes it
```

That costs nothing in fidelity. A phrase is assembled by the reader anyway —
`readRelation` builds it out of two fields and the line never stores it — so
kind-first is the same two fields in the other order.

**One way in and it goes.** More than one and it says what it would merge and
waits:

```
$ add kind
  kind — 2 ways
     kind           8   all of them
     kind example   5
     kind is-a      3
  say it again to mean it, anything else to cancel
```

Saying it again takes all of them. `is-a kind` and `example kind` are the two
ends of one relation, so that column holds what each kind is an example of and
what is an example of it, together. Nothing sorts that out for you.

**A column is called by what it holds.** One way in and the column says the
phrase, because being specific is free when it is the only choice. Several and
it says the kind, because that is the honest name for a merge.

```
   resolves-to host        one way to a host from the dns export
      ran-as account       one way to an account from a host
>        raised ticket
```

Backwards needs no `rev`, no sigil, no setting: the producer wrote both verbs
into the one relation, so `ip has-address` is a name they chose. A relation
whose producer said nothing at all is `related` in both directions, and the
reader marks that word as its own.

**There are no sigils.**

## Every column after the first is a join

A line is one hop, so a column of more than two columns is reading across
lines, and what it joins on is the string in the cell to its left. That is the
only thing a step does, so nothing has to mark it.

**Merging adds no lines and creates knowledge.** No single pile gets from
`10.2.14.7` to `dana`. Merged, the route exists, and it is in none of the
lines.

```
  resolves-to host | ran-as account | raised ticket via ran-as account
  -----------------+----------------+---------------------------------
  backup-03.corp   | svc-deploy     | OPS-4412
  mail-01.corp     | ?              | ?
  web-01.corp      | www-data       | ?
```

`?` is a hole: mail-01 ran nothing, and the row says so rather than disappearing.

The one worth staring at is the nursery. `garden.pile` is a receipt — who
ordered, what they ordered, where it ships. It shares exactly one string with
the auth log, `web-01.corp`, because the order happened to be placed from a
machine somebody else was logging. Neither producer knew the other existed:

```
  flower            | listed-on receipt (short) | submitted-from host via listed-on receipt | ran-as account via submitted-from host via listed-on receipt
  ------------------+---------------------------+-------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------
  Barbara Karst     | cde                       | web-01.corp                               | www-data
  Casa Blanca       | cde                       | web-01.corp                               | www-data
  Mme Isaac Pereire | cde                       | web-01.corp                               | www-data
```

It overlaps twice more, and the second one goes the other way. The rose was
bred in `paris`, and `rfg.pile` has `paris` in a csv row, a key-value block and
a json object whose `geo` is a town — so a flower reaches a json blob through a
city name, with nothing in between but the string. And `10.0.0.5` is an `addr`
somebody parsed out of that object and an `ip` the nursery's greenhouse
controller answers to, which is a join the tool will happily make and cannot
vouch for. That is the point of `?` and the point of reading the pivot.

**A join is not a verdict.** It says two lines share a string; it says nothing
about whether joining on it was sound, and the tool cannot say, because a pile
holds no identity. Five lines sharing `alice|2026-08-25|projX|5|2` are five
fields of one timesheet row and joining them invents nothing. Two hops sharing
a router are two different routes passing through one machine, and reading
across them makes a path nobody walked.

What lets you tell them apart is already in the table: **a join pivots on the
value you were standing on, so the pivot is the cell immediately to the left.**
Read left and you are looking at the string the join was made on — and if a
route is one of your columns, you are looking at the whole route, which either
contains what the row claims or does not.

```
  produced route                | hops ip   | next host via hops ip
  ------------------------------+-----------+----------------------
  10.2.14.7,10.2.0.1,192.0.2.9  | 10.2.0.1  | 203.0.113.5
  10.9.0.4,10.2.0.1,203.0.113.5 | 10.2.0.1  | 203.0.113.5
```

Both rows pass through `10.2.0.1`, and one of them is claiming a hop that is not
in its own route's text. The evidence is in the row. It used to be a decision
you made before you could see anything.

## The shell

You traverse a tree, and from the tree you add what you want. Moving never
creates and never removes; only `add` changes anything.

```
   resolves-to host
      ran-as account
>        raised ticket

  assigned-to person 1/1   raised-by account 1/1
```

That whole block is the prompt — printed before every input, so the tree is
always there. The focused line is marked and, on a screen, coloured. Under it,
what can be added here, with how many of this column's values can do it. The
table comes back when the tree changed, and only then; `table` asks for it any
time.

**`/` is the pile, and it holds every kind anybody named.** Naming one is
where a reading starts and the only thing in the tool that is not a move.

**A reading starts by naming a kind, and that kind is the first column** — a
row for every value it reaches. `host` is the hosts, `ip` is the addresses, and
neither direction is the awkward one.

There is no starting from a string. A reading begins with a relation or it does
not begin. That is a simplification and it may be relaxed later; today it means
`/` lists 78 kinds instead of 78 kinds and 385 strings jumbled together.

A reading has one starting point, because a table has one set of rows, so
naming a second thing replaces the reading. It asks twice.

```
add [path]    cd [path]      table          jump [kind] [n]
tree [flat]   shorten [path] save <name>    taxonomy [name]   query   help   quit
```

`add` on its own lists everything you could add here — the offers with their
counts, and at `/` every kind in the pile. `add ../x` is a sibling, `add a/b/c`
is a chain creating as it goes, and a partial name adds nothing and lists what it
matched. Between them there is nothing left for a command that only looks.

At `/` that listing is the kinds, with how many rows each would open with and
whether choosing it is a choice:

```
  78 kind(s) · naming one is the first column
  string           251     14 ways
  short-string     158
  word             152     2 ways
  text             42      8 ways
  host             15      6 ways
```

The ways themselves stay out of it until you ask, which is what `add host` does.
The always-on line under the tree is the same list with the count of ways
appended — `record 16/16·3` — because that mark has to survive a pipe: the
transcript the harness diffs has no colour in it.

A value can be a whole document, and a document in a menu is not a long line, it
is the screen. So a listing counts the ones too long to be a line rather than
printing them — counted, not cut, and a fragment still reaches every one.

## When you do not know the way

One step at a time is fine until you do not know which steps. Enumerating
everything two and three steps out is the obvious answer and it does not fit:
from the `string` column that is 271 routes and then 1950. So `jump` asks the
same question one step asks — **name the kind you are after** — with a distance
on it.

```
$ jump ip
  from username-of record · 3 route(s) reaching ip within 3 steps
  notes/ip                  3/10
  password-record/notes/ip  3/10
  string/notes/ip           3/10
  add one of them
```

Three instead of 475. Every step of a route is a kind, merged the same way a
single step is, so the count is the count you get when you walk it — and the
route is an `add` path, verbatim:

```
$ add notes/ip
```

`jump` on its own is the same list one level up: every kind within reach, how
far the nearest route is, and how many routes there are.

**It is the one thing here that only looks**, and it can be, because what it
hands back is something you then type. Finding a route and taking it stay two
acts, so `add` is still the only thing that changes anything.

A route that returns to the row it started from is marked `comes back` rather
than hidden. It is a real route and whether it is worth walking is not something
the tool can know.

## Columns you step over rather than read

Walking from a record out to an ip goes through the record's notes, and one of
those notes is 700 characters of a BitLocker recovery key. The column is a
prerequisite, not something you came to read, and it makes the table unreadable
before you have read anything.

`shorten` draws that column as a hash:

```
  username-of record | has notes (short) | contains ip via has notes
  -------------------+-------------------+--------------------------
  PasswordRecord:77  | 7e8               | 10.20.30.1
  PasswordRecord:80  | 3b4               | 203.0.113.42
  PasswordRecord:82  | 1ef               | ?
```

The third column proves the point: `contains ip` walked out of the whole notes
text, not out of the stub. **Nothing is asserted and nothing is lost.** The value
is untouched everywhere it means anything — it is still what the column joins
on, still what the next step walks from, still what a menu counts. `shorten`
again puts it back.

A hash rather than an ellipsis, because two documents that share an opening
would ellipse to the same thing and the table would be claiming a collision that
is not there. The stub is the shortest length that still tells that column's
values apart, so it can never claim two different strings are one.

This is the one place the tool draws something other than the value, and it is
never automatic: a column cannot be known to be a waypoint until you have seen
what is in it. Taking a jumped route is the closest thing to an exception —
you asked for the far end, so the middles are waypoints by construction — but
`account` and `ticket` are middles too, and hashing a nine-character account
name loses more than it saves. So the chain arrives whole and you say
`shorten ..`.

`sw.ts <file>` runs a script and hands you the shell wherever it left off.

## Kinds come out of the relations for free

The kind is the last word of every phrase you type, so it is already on the
column, in the tree, and in the menu:

```
  previous ip   next ip   has-address ip   hops ip
```

Nobody added a line for that. It was inside the relations, and the reader can
read it now that the shape says where to look.

There is no command for this. A report regrouping what is already on screen is
not worth a verb; the shell holds moves and views of the reading, not reports
about the pile.

The part worth staring at: `ip` appears inside four relations **and** as a value
in `kinds.pile`, where somebody wrote
`["ip","kind, is-a, example, kind","address"]`. So `ip` is a string you can
name, and naming it gives a first column headed `ip` like naming any other
string. The vocabulary inside a relation and a taxonomy somebody exported meet
as the same string, with no mechanism at all.

## A value and a kind are the same slot

```
["ip", "kind, is-a, example, kind", "address"]
["10.2.14.7", "ip, resolves-to, has-address, host", "backup-03.corp"]
```

The same shape of line. One is about a kind and one is about an address, and
nothing in the format says which is which.

That is not an oversight waiting to be tidied up. Write the chain out and it
does not stop at either end:

```
itstuff
   endpoint
      address
         ip
            192.168.1.1
               192.168.1.1 used as default on Linksys routers
                  192.168.1.1 used as default on my Linksys router
```

**So the line between a type and a value is where somebody stopped walking, not
a fact about the world.** A typed system treats it as ontology: there are
categories, there are instances, and they are different sorts of thing. Here
they are strings, `is-a` is one more fact rather than a structural privilege,
and how far along the chain you went is a choice nothing records.

Nothing *could* record it, which is the honest half. No line says how specific
`192.168.1.1` is, because you can always write another one below it. What you
can ask is *what is this an example of* and *what is an example of this*, and
both are ordinary walks in the two directions of one relation.

It is also why a chain is lines rather than a longer line. Five levels is four
facts. Putting them in one line would put the chain in the line's structure,
and structure is not a string — which is where this whole format started.

## A taxonomy is a reader's, not the pile's

Eighty-five kinds is a screen of names, and a gardener wants two of them:
`flower` and `itstuff`. A taxonomy is that vocabulary — names for groups of
kinds — and it belongs to whoever is reading. The shell takes one with
`taxonomy <name>` or `--taxonomy`, read.ts with `--taxonomy`, and the page from
its picker:

```
$ taxonomy triage
  triage · 11 names over 70/70 of its kinds in this pile
$ add
  6 name(s) · triage · naming one is the first column
  network        51   17 kinds · 47 ways
  identity       60   11 kinds · 15 ways
  text-shape    300   15 kinds · 40 ways
  tabular        59   13 kinds · 44 ways
  time           15   6 kinds · 9 ways
  geography       8   8 kinds · 10 ways

  15 kind(s) outside triage · add --all shows them
```

**Only its names are shown.** The listing is the taxonomy's top level in the
order its author wrote it, and a kind it says nothing about is not listed at all
— as if it did not exist, but for the count at the bottom. `add --all` lists
every kind again, and so does *show everything* on the page. Nothing is taken out
of the pile: a hidden kind is still typeable and still reached by every step.

On its own, `taxonomy` draws the tree, counted from where the cursor is:

```
  triage           374   70 kinds
     network        51   17 kinds
        address     24   5 kinds
           ip  internal-ip  valid-ip  addr  host
        locator     13   2 kinds
           url  email
        subnets      5   6 kinds
           subnet  cidr  mask  octet4  last-octet  octet-sum
        path         3   2 kinds
           route  trace
        port  endpoint
     identity       60   11 kinds
        person  name  first-name  last-name  username  account  emp  company

A name carries the count of values it reaches, because that is the one thing
about it you cannot read off its name. A leaf carries its name and nothing else.

**The engine never sees a taxonomy.** Before a name reaches the session it is
written out as the group of kinds it stands for, and a group is a step in the
query language like any other — one column, called by its name, merging every
way into any of its kinds:

```
$ add network*
$ query
  ./read.ts 'network{addr, cidr, email, endpoint, host, internal-ip, ip, last-octet, mask, octet-sum, octet4, port, route, subnet, trace, url, valid-ip}*'
  ./read.ts --taxonomy triage 'network*'
```

So a saved reading means the same with or without anybody's vocabulary, and two
taxonomies that both say `subnets` for different kinds cannot make one string
mean two readings. The short form is for whoever holds the taxonomy:
`--taxonomy triage` writes `network` out again before anything is asked.

**A group is added and typed exactly like a kind.** More than one way in needs
`*`, and the kinds under it stay typeable underneath — `network*`, then `ip`,
then `ip resolves-to`. A group reached by only one way is called by that phrase,
the same as a kind.

**The counts are unions, never sums.** `text-shape` reads 300 where its fifteen
kinds add up to about 670 — the strings that are a `word` and a `string` and a
`short-string` at once. That cannot be worked out from the kinds' own counts, so
a client sends its groups with every request and the view counts them. The groups
shape that one answer and are gone.

**A member need not be in the pile.** The gardener's `itstuff` lists `byte`,
`computername` and `cpu`, which nobody here wrote. They stay in the group and
are said to be missing — in the shell's tree, and struck through on the page —
so the day a document with a cpu in it arrives, every query that names `itstuff`
covers it already. A group is refused only when none of its kinds can be reached:

```
$ ./read.ts --taxonomy gardener 'flower*/itstuff/itstuff'
  flower            | watered-by host    | has-address ip via watered-by host
  ------------------+--------------------+-----------------------------------
  Barbara Karst     | greenhouse-01.corp | 10.0.0.5
  Casa Blanca       | ?                  | ?
  Mme Isaac Pereire | ?                  | ?
```

**Never THE taxonomy.** Swap one inside a session and the reading does not move;
what is offered from the same `network` column reads differently under each:

```
  network 44/51·38   identity 2/51   text-shape 23/51·5   tabular 7/51·5

  addresses 22/51·13   host 17/51·5   subnets 4/51·10   services 8/51·4
  paths 8/51·3   locators 7/51·3   noise 24/51·10
```

Same rows, same steps, same 51 values. `triage` says *you are inside the network
world and 44 of 51 stay in it*; `netops` says *here is where inside*, and calls
the text machinery `noise`, which is the honest name for it to that reader.

**A taxonomy may only merge. It may never assert.** Every column a group builds
could be built by writing the group out by hand. It adds no line, changes no
value, and dropping it leaves every record identical, which is what makes it safe
to be wrong about: being wrong costs you one reading.

**A taxonomy is a hypothesis, not a law.** The counts check it as they go. From
that `network` column `addresses` reads 22, exactly what `ip` reads alone, so
nothing else under it reaches a value `ip` does not — the pile agreeing with
what the taxonomy claimed was narrower. It could have disagreed, and the menu
would have said so as a number, with nothing stopping you.

**A taxonomy is lines.** `taxonomies/<name>.pile` is a pile file, every line one
edge of the tree with the child on the left:

```
["ip", "kind, is-a, example, kind", "address"]
```

A name hangs off one parent, there is one top, and nothing is under itself. It
lives outside `pile/` because everything in the pile is loaded always, and a
vocabulary nobody asked for should not decide what the root lists. The shell and
read.ts read it from disk; the page fetches it from the server, reads it with the
same `taxonomy.ts`, and keeps its name in the URL as `t=` — beside the session,
not in it.

## One reading, one table

The shell is where a reading is found. `read.ts` is where it is asked for
again, with nothing asked back: a query in, the table out, and nothing else on
stdout.

```sh
./read.ts 'host resolves-to/account/ticket'
./read.ts 'host resolves-to/(account/ticket, ip has-address)'
./read.ts 'record username-of/notes~/ip'
./read.ts --taxonomy gardener 'flower*/receipt~/host/account'
```

A step is exactly what `add` takes — a kind, a kind narrowed by a verb, a group
— and the rest of a query is the few characters a kind can never contain:

```
a/b          b is a step from a
a/(b, c/d)   b and c both hang off a, and d hangs off c
a*           every way into a, said on purpose
a~           a's column drawn shortened
n{a, b}      one column called n, merging the kinds a and b
```

Whitespace around them means nothing, so a long query can be laid out like the
tree it describes. Always single-quote one: it has spaces and brackets in it,
and inside single quotes `*` and `~` are safe.

**Strict, because it cannot ask.** A kind with more than one way in, written
without `*`, is refused with the ways listed — in the shell and in a query alike
— because a query that meant one way today would otherwise quietly mean two the
day a second producer arrives:

```
$ ./read.ts 'domain/email/user'
read: 'domain/email/user'
              ^ email has 2 ways from has domain · say email* or narrow it
     email domain-of   6/6
     email host-of     2/6
```

**Exact, for the same reason.** Names are whole, in the shell too: a miss adds
nothing and says what you probably meant. A saved query that resolved a partial
name one way today and another way tomorrow is worse than one that fails.

**Groups are in the string; taxonomies are not.** A group carries its kinds, so
a query names everything it merges and needs nothing beside it to be read. A
taxonomy only decided how the group got typed.

**`query` in the shell writes it for you.** It prints the reading you built as a
`./read.ts` command, kind first, `*` where you merged, `~` where you shortened
and a group's kinds sorted — so two people's queries for one reading are one
string — and, under a taxonomy, the shorter `--taxonomy` form beside it. The
replay checks the round trip: every saved reading's query, run through `read.ts`,
has to draw the table the shell drew.

## One session, three clients

The shell, read.ts and the page do not each know how to build a reading.
`session.ts` does, as one pure state machine:

```
step(ctx, session, command)         -> { session, message }
view(ctx, session, message, groups) -> view
```

A session is `{ query, focus }` — the reading written down, and the path to the
cursor — and never a pile. A command is `add`, `cd`, `shorten` or `query`, done
whole or not at all; one that cannot be done gives back the session it was given
and a message saying why. The shell holds its session in a variable. read.ts
asks for one view. `server.ts` holds no session at all: every request brings the
one it is about, so a restart loses nothing. The page keeps its session in the
URL, so a reload keeps your place, a link reopens a reading, and the back button
is undo.

```sh
npm run gui                           # tsc -p gui, then ./server.ts on 127.0.0.1:7474
./server.ts --introduce mine.pile     # the server cuts once, at start
```

```
POST /step                  { session, command, groups } -> { session, view }
GET  /taxonomies/           the taxonomy names
GET  /taxonomies/<n>.pile   one of them, as lines
GET  /                      the page
```

`api.ts` is the contract: types only, so the page imports the shapes without a
line of the engine. When a client needs something those shapes do not carry, it
arrives as a change to that file. Localhost, no token — anything on this machine
can ask the server for the pile.

## Keeping a reading

A scenario is a session. Play, then keep what you typed:

```
$ # every host, its account, and what they raised
$ add host resolves-to
$ add account/ticket
$ save hosts-and-accounts
  3 line(s) -> scenarios/hosts-and-accounts.sw
```

```sh
./scenarios.ts > check/scenarios.txt
git diff check/scenarios.txt        # did any saved reading move?
```

The harness drives the real shell with the script on stdin, so it covers path
resolution, matching, the tree, the menus and the table. Piped in, the shell
echoes each command, so the output is a transcript and a diff points at the
command whose result changed.

It runs against whatever is in `pile/introduced/`. Add a line and the diff tells you
which readings it altered. Nothing is asserted and nothing screams: a renamed
relation leaves a table with no rows, a vanished column leaves a step
unapplied, a step that finds nothing leaves holes. Each is a change you read in
the diff.

## The concepts, all of them

- **A line is one fact, exactly three strings.** Values are transcription;
  relations are interpretation.
- **A pile is a set of lines.** Merging is a union.
- **A relation is kinds at the ends and verbs between them**, and a producer
  fills in as much as they know — down to nothing.
- **A step is a kind**, with the verb as an optional qualifier. No direction,
  because a phrase already is one, and no mode, because a one-hop fact leaves
  nothing to stay inside.
- **A kind with several ways in merges them**, and says so before it does.
- **A column is called by what it holds** — the phrase when there is one way
  in, the kind when it merged several.
- **Every column after the first joins on the column to its left**, so the
  pivot is always there to read and never has to be reported.
- **A reading starts by naming a kind, and that kind is the first column.**
- **A value and a kind are the same slot.** Where the chain from `itstuff` down
  to one address stops is where a reader stopped, and no line records it.
- **A path is a value.** If order matters, the ordered thing is a string you
  can stand on, and the facts about it are more lines.
- **A taxonomy is a reader's vocabulary, not the pile's.** It may merge and never
  assert, anyone can bring their own over the same lines, and the engine only
  ever sees the groups it writes out.

## What it refuses

Three strings with a relation in the middle is what RDF is. The ways this is not
that are the load-bearing part.

**No minted identity.** RDF joins on URIs, so a merge depends on producers
having coordinated, or on `sameAs` lines that are themselves claims somebody has
to stand behind. Here the join is on the literal bytes. `paris` in a nursery
receipt and `paris` in a json blob are one node because they are one string, and
nobody arranged it. That is why `cat pile/introduced/*.pile | sort -u` is the whole merge
— and it is the same reason nothing can tell a sound join from an unsound one.
What would let it is what it declined to record.

**No inference.** A class in RDFS or OWL entails triples a reasoner then adds. A
taxonomy derives nothing. It names groups of kinds for one reader, and dropping
it leaves the pile and every reading exactly as they were.

**No shared vocabulary.** The relation carries its own — kinds at the ends,
verbs between — so every line says what it means in both directions and there is
no ontology to fetch, agree on, or version.

What the three buy is that a merge needs no algorithm. Counts would have to sum,
order would conflict, timestamps would need reconciling clocks; none of it
exists, so a union is the entire operation and eight uncoordinated producers are
safe to `cat` together. **The commitment that usually happens at write time
happens at read time here, and read time is revisable.** Being wrong about a
taxonomy costs one reading. Being wrong in a system that enforced one costs the
data, and you find out years later when somebody asks a question nobody
anticipated.

The price is that the tool will not be an oracle. It puts the evidence beside
the claim — the pivot in the column to the left, the whole route sitting in the
row — and stops. That works for a reader who can judge thirty rows. It does not
become *the system tells you the answer*, and it never will, because what would
make it authoritative is the identity it gave up.

## Deliberately not here

No picture. No grouping of relations that mean the same thing — a group merges
kinds, and the same move over verbs is not built. No way to remove
a column short of starting the reading over. Nothing caps how wide a column
gets, so one value from `rfg.pile` runs to thousands of characters across.

There is no way for a third party to name a relation its producer left empty.
`""` is an invitation to say it later and nothing accepts the invitation. That
is a gap, not a decision.

**Nothing tells a sound join from an unsound one**, and nothing can from the
lines alone — that needs identity, which a pile refuses to record on purpose.
The reader does it by looking at the pivot.

**You cannot walk inside a route.** `10.2.14.7,10.2.0.1,192.0.2.9` is one
string, and the tool never looks inside a string, so *what came after
`10.2.0.1` in this route* is a question for a person reading the value. What the
pile answers is *which routes contain `10.2.0.1`*. If walking a route turns out
to be worth having, the way in is more lines — the route travelled so far as
the thing you are standing on, with one relation stepping from each prefix to
the next — and it can be added without touching a line already written.

## The open question

If left and right are transcription and the middle is interpretation, then the
two halves of a line may not deserve the same permissions. A value should never
be revised; revising it is falsifying a record. A relation is somebody's
reading of what they saw, and a better reading should be allowed to replace it.

Nothing in the tool does this today — a pile is append-only and merging is a
union, which is what makes seven uncoordinated producers safe to `cat`
together. But the empty relation is already an invitation: it is a line saying
*something goes here and I do not know what yet*, and the obvious next thing
anyone will want is to say it later.
